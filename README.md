# TV7-Playlist

## Summary

This little application is used to rewrite the TV7 multicast channel list by fiber7 m3u.
The updated list will proxy the multicast stream through udpxy and builds a stream that plex can handle.

Others have changed the code in telly. As I did not want to change any external source, I just
wrote this little application.

There are more features than just changing the URL:

- Resorting of the channel list
- Enable or disable a channel
- Override the channel number -> better EPG Detection support in plex / emby
- Override the channel name -> better EPG Detection support in plex / emby
