# tv7playlist

This little application is used to rewrite the TV7 multicast channel list by fiber7 m3u.
The updated list will proxy the multicast stream through udpxy and builds a stream that plex can handle.

Others have changed the code in telly. As I did not want to change any external source, I just
wrote this little program.
